# Bookstrap

Bookstrap is a HTML framework for making book apps.

See [bookstrap.org](http://bookstrap.org).

## Requirements

Bookstrap requires [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org) to be installed with npm. Node version >= v0.8.x is recommended.

## Project set-up

	npm install -g grunt-cli
	npm install
	
Make sure grunt is installed globally and install the project dependencies.

## Viewing the sample publication

    grunt server

This will start a web server. The local web address is printed on the console.

## Modifying CSS

Make sure you edit .less files only. To re-compile your LESS automatically, run the following command.

    grunt watch

### Building JavaScript and CSS for distribution

    grunt build

This will generate files in the "dist" folder.

## How to build for your device manually

Follow the Apache Cordova [Getting Started guide](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.2.0/guide_getting-started_index.md.html) for your platform. Once you have created your project, remove the www folder and replace it with www folder in this repository.

## How to test in a web browser

### Method 1: Use Chrome

1. Launch Terminal
2. Close Chrome if it is open already.
3. Run the following command to run Chrome:

````
	/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --allow-file-access-from-files
````

4\. Open index.html in Chrome

This will make sure Chrome can read local files using AJAX.

### Method 2: Use a web server

Launch terminal and enter the following commands

````
cd your/path/to/bookstrap
grunt server
````

Open your browser at http://localhost:4000
